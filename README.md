# Customer Segmentation Analysis

## This repository and its accompanying article delve into various techniques for clustering, visualizing, and interpreting clustering algorithms and their outputs. The exploration covers k-Means and DBSCAN as clustering algorithms, alongside t-SNE and PCA for dimensionality reduction. Additionally, the process includes employing variance techniques and assessing feature importance to select variables that distinctly represent clusters.


## Dimensionality Reduction
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA reduces the dimensionality of the data while retaining most of the variance. This step helps in visualizing the data and speeding up clustering algorithms.

t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
t-SNE is used for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, particularly effective for visualizing high-dimensional data. It helps in understanding the structure of clusters.

## Clustering Algorithms
k-Means Clustering
k-Means partitions the data into k clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster.

DBSCAN
DBSCAN clusters data based on density, making it effective in identifying clusters of varying shapes and sizes, as well as handling noise and outliers.

## Cluster Evaluation
Evaluate clustering results using metrics such as silhouette scores and Davies-Bouldin index to determine the optimal number of clusters and the quality of clustering.

## Feature Importance and Selection
Use variance techniques and feature importance metrics to select the most relevant features that distinctly represent the clusters. This enhances the interpretability and performance of the clustering algorithms.

## Visualization
Various visualization techniques, including scatter plots and cluster heatmaps, are used to illustrate the clusters and their characteristics. These visualizations help
